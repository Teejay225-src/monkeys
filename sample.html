		<h1>Where we are</h1>
		<p>Remember when we would stay out to late
                   We were young, having fun, made mistakes
                   Did we ever know?
                   Did we ever know?
                   Did we ever know? Yeah...
	           All the things we just think out the same
                   Never wrong, always right, not afraid
                   Did we ever know?
                   Did we ever know?
                   Did we ever know?
                   Is it all inside of my head?
                   Maybe you still think I don't care
                   But all I need is you
                   Yeah, you know it's true
                   Yeah, you know it's true
                   Forget about where we are
                   And let go, we're so close
                   If you don't know where to start
                   Just hold on and don't run
                   No...
                   We're looking back
                   We're messing around
                   But that was then
                   And this is now
                   All we need is enough love
                   To hold us
                   Where we are
                   Summer days, rushing by you and me
                   Makes it harder to see underneath
                   Did we ever know?
                   Did we ever know?
                   Did we ever know?

                   With close eyes and open mind
                   We can be there
                   We can be there
                   But this sign
                   Let's cross the line
                   Can you see it?
